# nf-core Sarek Pipeline Project

## Objective: 
This project aims to demonstrate the use of the nf-core Sarek pipeline to execute a germline variant-calling workflow using Nextflow. 
The pipeline processes sequence data from an individual and performs germline variant calling.

## About nf-core Sarek Pipeline
The nf-core Sarek pipeline is a part of the nf-core project, which offers expert-curated Nextflow pipelines for various 
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) workflows. Sarek is designed for whole-genome sequencing analysis of germline and somatic variants, 
including SNP calling, small indel identification, and copy number variant detection.

## Data: 
The project utilizes 30X paired-end Illumina sequence data from a single individual (NA12878) sourced from the 1000 Genomes Project.
