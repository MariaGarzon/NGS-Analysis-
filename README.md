## Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Analysis Projects Repository

Welcome to my Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Analysis Projects Repository! This repository showcases a collection of projects I completed during my Master's program in Bioinformatics at New York Univeristy, specifically focusing on the analysis of large-scale datasets generated by modern sequencing technologies.

### About the NGS Analysis Course
The Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Analysis course formed the foundation of my expertise in bioinformatics. This course introduced me to various methodological approaches for analyzing the vast amount of data generated by cutting-edge sequencing technologies. Throughout the course, I gained practical experience and learned essential techniques to streamline the processing of genomics datasets. A key emphasis of this course was equipping students with the skills to deploy NGS workflows within a high-performance computing (HPC) environment.

### Course Objectives Achieved
By the end of the NGS Analysis course, I had successfully achieved the following objectives:

#### Executing NGS Workflows in an HPC Environment 
I developed the capability to efficiently run NGS workflows in a high-performance computing environment, allowing for the rapid analysis of large and complex genomics datasets.

#### Conducting Quality Control of Raw NGS Datasets 
I learned how to perform rigorous quality control assessments on raw NGS datasets crucial for downstream analysis. 

#### Drawing Biological Insights from NGS Workflow Outputs
I gained the expertise to extract, interpret and communicate valuable biological insights from the results generated by common NGS workflows. 

### Repository Contents
In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that demonstrate my proficiency in NGS data analysis. Each project is accompanied by detailed documentation, code, and explanations, providing a comprehensive overview of the methods employed and the biological insights obtained.

Feel free to explore the projects, review the code, and delve into the analyses to gain a better understanding of my capabilities in NGS data analysis.

If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on any bioinformatics-related projects, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find my NGS analysis projects informative and inspiring!
