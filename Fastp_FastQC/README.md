# Next Generation Sequence Analysis - Week 2

## Description:
This project involves the pre-processing of raw Illumina short read sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project. 
The primary objective is to execute various tasks on the high-performance computing cluster Greene, including running quality control 
tools, adapter trimming, and generating quality reports. The project is structured into three main tasks:

Task 1: Processing a single sample using fastp with Slurm.
Task 2: Parallel processing of 21 samples with fastp and fastqc using a job array.
Task 3: Generating a multi-sample quality control report with MultiQC.

The project aims to teach NGS data pre-processing, Slurm job execution, and quality control using real data.
