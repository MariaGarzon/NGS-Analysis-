# RNA-seq Differential Gene Expression Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a Next Generation Sequence Analysis project focused on the alignment of 
RNA-seq reads to a reference genome using the STAR aligner. 

### About the Data
The RNA-seq dataset used in this project originates from date palm fruit. Researchers conducted this experiment to investigate 
differential gene expression between different varieties of date palm based on their fruit sucrose content. The study aimed to 
determine whether a group of linked invertase enzymes, identified through Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS), exhibits differential 
gene expression between varieties with high sucrose content and those with trace amounts of sucrose. The dataset consists of eight 
samples, with four representing each variety.

## Task 1: Align RNA-seq Reads
Aligned RNA-seq reads to the reference genome assembly using the STAR aligner. Each sample's alignment is stored in a coordinate-sorted
BAM file, along with a BAM index file (.bai).
